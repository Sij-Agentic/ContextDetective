2025-04-13 18:38:06,012 - ContextDetective - INFO - You are an agentic context detector that analyzes images to determine their context, meaning, and significance.

### Tool Usage:
- FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1|param2|... (one per line)
- Include 'FUNCTION_CALL:', function_name|, and parameters (if necessary)
- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

The signs feature slogans such as \"Resist!\" and \"Only You Can Prevent.\"\n*   **American Context:** The presence of American flags and the English language on the signs suggest that this event takes place in the United States.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   **Dense and Chaotic:** The composition is extremely dense, reflecting the sheer number of people and signs present. This creates a sense of energy, and urgency.\n*   **Crowded Foreground:** The foreground is filled with people and signs, drawing the viewer directly into the scene.\n*   **Depth of Field:** The depth of field appears moderate, keeping a reasonable amount of the image in focus.\n*   **Lack of Central Focus:** The image lacks a single, dominant focal point. The eye is drawn to various signs and faces within the crowd.\n\n**Visual Techniques:**\n\n*   **Natural Lighting:** The lighting seems to be natural, possibly overcast or daytime lighting.\n*   **Color Palette:** The image features a varied color palette, with a mix of bright and muted tones. The signs are colorful, while clothing appears relatively muted.\n*   **Texture:** The image captures a sense of texture through the details of the signs, clothing, and faces.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image conveys a sense of energy, urgency, and collective action. It's a powerful snapshot of a protest, emphasizing the sheer number of people participating and the diverse messages being conveyed.

- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

### Tool Usage:
- FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1|param2|... (one per line)
- Include 'FUNCTION_CALL:', function_name|, and parameters (if necessary)
- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

The scene is densely packed, with signs overlapping and people standing close together.\n\n**People:**\n\n*   A diverse group of people of various ages, ethnicities, and genders are present.\n*   Most are facing forward, presumably towards a focal point outside the frame.\n*   Clothing styles vary but appear to be casual, suitable for an outdoor gathering.\n*   Facial expressions are not clearly visible due to the distance and crowd density, but some appear focused or determined.\n\n**Objects:**\n\n*   **Signs and Banners:** This is the most prominent element. There are numerous signs of various sizes and materials (cardboard, paper, fabric).\n*   **Flags:** American flags are interspersed throughout the crowd.\n*   **Clothing Accessories:** Some individuals wear hats, sunglasses, and scarves.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   The color palette is varied due to the different signs, clothing, and skin tones.\n*   White and bright colors, such as red, blue, and green, are noticeable on the signs, creating contrast.\n*   Earth tones are present in clothing and background elements.\n\n**Text:**\n\nSeveral pieces of text are clearly visible.
