2025-04-13 15:59:57,884 - ContextDetective - INFO - You are an agentic context detector that analyzes images to determine their context, meaning, and significance.

### Tool Usage:
- FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1|param2|... (one per line)
- Include 'FUNCTION_CALL:', function_name|, and parameters (if necessary)
- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

The signs indicate a protest or demonstration.\n*   **Context:** Given the prevalence of phrases like \"Resist,\" \"Stop Traitors,\" and the presence of American flags, it's highly likely this is a political demonstration or rally. The sheer number of signs and people suggests a significant event.\n\n**Artistic Style and Aesthetics:**\n\n*   **Documentary Photography:** The image appears to be a photograph taken in a documentary or journalistic style. The focus is on capturing a real-world event as it unfolds, without any obvious signs of artificial manipulation or staging.\n*   **Realism:** The image aims to realistically depict the scene, with no deliberate stylistic exaggeration or distortion.\n*   **Energetic and Chaotic:** The overall aesthetic is energetic and somewhat chaotic. The density of the crowd, the variety of signs, and the general activity contribute to this feeling.\n\n**Cultural Elements:**\n\n*   **Political Activism:** The signs and slogans clearly denote a culture of political activism and protest, where people feel compelled to voice their opinions and concerns through public demonstration.\n*   **American Culture:** The inclusion of American flags places the event within the context of American political culture and discourse.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n*   **Crowded Composition:** The composition is deliberately crowded to emphasize the large number of participants.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Moderate depth of field allows for a good number of people to be clear, to give the viewer the sense of the depth of the crowd.\n*   **Rule of Thirds:** The photograph mostly follows the rule of thirds.\n\n**Visual Techniques:**\n\n*   **Natural Lighting:** The image appears to be lit by natural daylight, which contributes to the realistic and unadorned aesthetic.\n*   **Focus and Clarity:** The primary focus is on the people and their signs in the foreground and mid-ground. While the background is less sharp, it still provides a sense of the crowd's extent.\n*   **Color Palette:** The color palette is natural and muted, reflective of the clothing worn by the participants and the outdoor environment. The vibrancy of the signs provides some contrast.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image conveys a sense of the scale and energy of a political demonstration. It's a documentary-style photograph that seeks to capture the reality of the event, conveying the passion and engagement of the participants.
