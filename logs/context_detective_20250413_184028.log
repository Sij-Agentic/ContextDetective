2025-04-13 18:40:32,869 - ContextDetective - INFO - You are an agentic context detector that analyzes images to determine their context, meaning, and significance.

### Tool Usage:
- FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1|param2|... (one per line)
- Include 'FUNCTION_CALL:', function_name|, and parameters (if necessary)
- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

2025-04-13 18:40:42,386 - ContextDetective - INFO - You are an agentic context detector that analyzes images to determine their context, meaning, and significance.

### Tool Usage:
- FUNCTION_CALL: tool_name|param1|param2|... (one per line)
- Include 'FUNCTION_CALL:', function_name|, and parameters (if necessary)
- FINAL_ANSWER: result

### Workflow Steps:
1. Analyze the image using multiple perspectives (-- IMPORTANT -- Ensure visual analysis performed before moving on to search terms):
   - Visual elements (objects, people, colors, text)
   - Style and aesthetics (artistic style, cultural elements)
   - Possible scenarios (what might be happening) 
2. Generate search terms based on findings -- Perform all visual analysis before search term query
3. Explore the web for supporting evidence
4. Infer the most likely context
5. Provide structured output with confidence rating

### Tools:
1. describe_visual_elements(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the visual elements in an image.
2. describe_style_or_aesthetics(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe the style and aesthetic features of an image.
3. describe_possible_scenario(image_path: string) - Analyze and describe possible scenarios or contexts for the image.
4. generate_search_terms(descriptions: array) - Generate relevant search terms from the image descriptions.
5. search_web(query: string) - Search the web for information related to the query.
6. fetch_links_and_snippets(query: string) - Fetch and extract relevant information from search results.
7. infer_context(visual_elements: string, style_analysis: string, scenario_analysis: string, web_findings: string) - Combine all analyses to infer the most likely context.
8. format_final_output(context_guess: string, confidence: number, explanation: string, related_links: array, search_terms: array) - Format the final output in the required JSON structure.

### Response Format:
For each step, use FUNCTION_CALL to execute tools.
When complete, provide FINAL_ANSWER with the structured output.

The focal point is the sheer number of individuals holding signs, creating a dense and visually busy composition.\n\n**People:**\n\n*   The crowd is comprised of a diverse group of individuals, suggesting people of different ages, ethnicities, and genders are represented.\n*   Many people are holding signs above their heads, obscuring their faces to some extent.\n*   They appear to be closely packed together.\n\n**Objects:**\n\n*   **Signs:** The most prominent objects are the numerous protest signs. These vary in size, shape, and color.\n*   **Flags:** There are a few American flags visible.\n*   **Clothing:** People are wearing a variety of clothing, including jackets, hats, and casual wear, indicating different weather conditions or personal styles.\n\n**Colors:**\n\n*   The image is primarily dominated by neutral colors like white, gray, and brown, stemming from the signs, clothing, and background elements (trees, buildings).\n*   There are pops of color throughout from the messages, graphics on signs, and some clothing items. Red, blue, green, and yellow are visible.\n\n**Text:**\n\nThere is text on a lot of the signs. Some of the decipherable text includes:\n\n*   \"Mel\"\n*   \"Public Defenders for Due Process\"\n*   \"Only You Can Prevent\"\n*   \"Resist!\"\n*   \"Stop Traitors\"\n*   \"Resist\"\n*   \"I Rise With\"\n\n**Structural Elements:**\n\n*   **Composition:** The image is a medium-range shot, showing the density of the crowd while still allowing some individuals and signs to be distinguished.\n*   **Background:** The background features blurred elements such as trees (some with reddish leaves), buildings, and possibly other structures that add depth and provide context.\n*   **Depth of Field:** The focus is primarily on the people and signs in the foreground and mid-ground, with the background appearing softer.\n\nIn summary, the image portrays a demonstration or protest with a diverse crowd holding signs containing a variety of messages. The colors are varied, but with neutral colors dominating overall. The textual elements on the signs reveal some of the potential motivations and goals of the demonstration.", "annotations": null}]}]

(Likely):** The style of the crowd, signs, and overall atmosphere points to a political demonstration in a major U.S. city.

The \\"Resist\\" sign is a common symbol of opposition to a particular administration or political agenda. The \\"Stop Traitors\\" sign suggests concerns about political corruption or betrayal.\\n2.  **Specific Issue Protest:** The signs might indicate a protest related to a specific issue, such as:\\n    *   **Social Justice/Equality:** The signs related to rights suggest that the protest may be related to social justice and equality.\\n    *   **Environmental Concerns:** If some signs are related to environmental issues, it could be an environmental protest.\\n3.  **Counter-Protest:** It\'s also possible, though less likely given the overall tone, that this is a counter-protest to another demonstration happening nearby.
